Web Dev Spring 2021 HW08 Status

Answer the following questions:


1. What's your name?

Haoqing Wang

2. What's the URL of the github repo with your work for this HW?

https://github.com/TereseWang/CS4550HW09

3. What's the URL that you deployed to?

Backend: http://events-spa-api.teresewang.com
(...with ending to be /api/v1/users, /api/v1/events, /api/v1/invites)
FrondEnd: http://events-spa.teresewang.com

4. Is your app functionality complete? If not, what's missing?

All functionality is complete

5. Is your app properly deployed? If not, what went wrong?

Can't get backend and frontend deploy to the same server name.

Also one thing happened, I can refresh page in the main page (the events-spa.teresewang.com), but when you refresh with other subpages it will show 404 error, however if you goes back to main page and refresh again, everything comes back.

All the functionality works as long as you don't refresh on other pages beside the main page. Don't know what had caused this problem since everything works including refreshing page when I tried with mix phx.server in my local. As long as you don't do refreshing, everything should update on timely based, so no effect on the overall usage of the website
